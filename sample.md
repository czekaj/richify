# Markdown Guide with Examples

Welcome to this Markdown guide where we'll explore how to use headings, lists, sections, and code snippets in your Markdown documents.

## Headings
Markdown provides 6 levels of headings, H1 to H6. Here's how to use them:

```markdown
# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
#### H4 Heading
##### H5 Heading
###### H6 Heading
```

## Lists
You can create bulleted or numbered lists.

### Bulleted Lists
To create a bulleted list, use either `*`, `-`, or `+`.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3
```

### Numbered Lists
For numbered lists, simply start each line with a number.

```markdown
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

## Code Snippets
Markdown allows you to include code snippets both inline and as blocks.

### Inline Code
Use backticks to add inline code. For example, \`code\` turns into `code`.

### Blocked Code Snippets
You can create a code block by indenting lines by four spaces or with three backticks. Optionally, you can add the programming language for syntax highlighting.

#### Python Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

#### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Sections
Dividing content into sections can improve readability.

### Section Example

Here's how you can organize information:

#### Part 1: Introduction

Start with an introductory text explaining what will be covered.

#### Part 2: Main Content

Dive into the main content of the document.

#### Part 3: Conclusion

Wrap up and summarize the key points.

## Using Markdown
Markdown is extremely useful for writing on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket as well as in many blogging platforms. It's simple yet powerful, providing all the tools to format your content without the overhead of a WYSIWYG editor.
